     40 saltine crackers
    ▢ 1 1/2 cups (333g) salted butter
    ▢ 1 1/2 cups (369) brown sugar
    ▢ 2 cups (400g) chocolate chips

    Preheat the oven to 400° F (205° C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

    Place the saltine crackers onto the parchment lined cookie sheet in a single layer. Set aside.

    40 saltine crackers

    In a medium sauce pan over medium heat, melt the butter and brown sugar together.

    1 1/2 cups (333g) salted butter, 1 1/2 cups (369) brown sugar

    Once the butter is completely melted, turn the heat up to medium high and stop stirring. Once the mixture begins to boil, start a timer for 3 minutes.

    When the mixture has been boiling for 3 minutes, remove from heat and pour over the saltine crackers.

    Spread to cover the crackers.

    Place the pan with the crackers and brown sugar and butter mixture into the 400° F (205° C) oven for 5 minutes. The mixture will be bubbling and it will look like the crackers and floating in the mixture.

    Remove from the oven and sprinkle the top with the chocolate chips.

    2 cups (400g) chocolate chips

    Return to the oven for about 1 minute, until the chocolate is completely melted.

    Remove from the oven and spread the chocolate to cover the top of the toffee.

    Allow the toffee to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes and then place in the fridge to help set up the toffee and chocolate faster.

    Once the toffee is completely cool, break or cut into pieces and enjoy!
