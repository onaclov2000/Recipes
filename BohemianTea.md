This is a delicious drink we make during the holidays.
* 12 Cups Water
* 4 Tea Bags (we normally use Black)
* Cinnamon Sticks (To Taste, but I'd like to add a concrete number here sometime)
* 8 whole cloves
* 1 Cup Sugar
* 6 oz frozen concentrated lemonade
* 6 oz frozen concentrated orange juice

Boil Water.
Turn temp down, steep tea for 5 minutes or so. (My mom's recipe suggests removing the tea bags, I just leave them in)
Add sugar (disolve)
Add lemonade, oj (I usually strain to make sure that there is no pulp, I'm not a fan of pulp)
Add cinnamon and cloves
