3 eggs 

1/2 cup butter melted (then during the mixing phase slowly add, so you don't scramble eggs)

1 1/2 cups white sugar 

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 

1 cup milk + 2 tablespoon lemon juice (Mix and let sit for at least 5 mins to make a lemony buttermilk)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

1/8 tablespoon freshly grated nutmeg 

2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

(bake 35-45 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean)
