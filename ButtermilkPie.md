3 eggs 

1/2 cup butter melted (then during the mixing phase slowly add, so you don't scramble eggs)

1 1/2 cups white sugar 

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 

1 cup milk + 2 tablespoon lemon juice (Mix and let sit for at least 5 mins to make a lemony buttermilk)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

1/8 tablespoon freshly grated nutmeg 

2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

(bake 35-45 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean)


Order of Operations:

Take Eggs out of fridge (might as well let them warm up a tad)

Mix Milk and Lemon immediately Set Timer for 5 minutes (preferrably 10)

microwave butter lightly (just melt it all, don't go crazy)

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees

Put Whisk Attachment on Kitchenaid

Beat Eggs

Add Sugar

Add Flour

Super Duper Slowly add Butter

Whip for a bit (I like to make it almost like whipped cream)

Add Vanilla, nutmeg, Whip a bit more (enough to mix is all)

Add lemon milk very slowly letting integrate

Get Pie Plates out. Arrange 2 on a pan.

Pour about half into one and half into the other pie pan (deep crust from Walmart is what I use).

Put in Oven. Timer to 30 minutes. Start checking after that for "done"
