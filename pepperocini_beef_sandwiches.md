This is for 1 serving, I'd argue you just take this recipe and figure out how to scale to the size meat you have.


Heat oil in a pot or large skillet over high heat. While the oil is heating, rub salt and pepper into meat.

Sear the roast on all sides in the hot oil until browned

Allow roast to cool. then transfer to a heavy freezer bag. Add minced garlic and pepperoncinis with liquid. Seal, Label and Freeze.

To cook: Thaw in fridge, Remove from freezer bag, and place in a slow cooker. Cook until roast shreds easily with a fork, on high 6-8 hours or low 8-10 hours.

To serve sandwiches, slice the rolls and spread lightly with mayo, and then top with shredded beef. Add a slice of provolone cheese and place under the broiler for 1-3 minutes or until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted. Serve Immediately.
