# Homemade Teriyaki Sauce
I make a quarter recipe (I just don't need so much), but based on this video:

## Ingredients
* 1/4 Cup Soy Sauce
* 1/4 Cup Mirin
* 1/8 Cup Sugar
* 1/8 Cup Honey
* 1/4 Cup Water
* .5 Tbsp Ginger
* 1 Tbsp Garlic to taste
* 1 Tbsp Sesame Seeds (Optional)
* 1/2 Tbsp Cornstarch

I use pre-minced garlic and ginger, and need to measure

## Directions
Except for cornstarch, mix all the ingredients in a pot on the stove.

Boil and simmer for 15 minutes

Mix cornstarch in small amount of water until it's a slurry (basically just mixed well, and no dry or lumps)

Pour into pot, and simmer a "few" more minutes and you're done.

### Options
I'll add Red Pepper Flakes Sometimes it's great.


# Salmon

Basically I just put sauce on it for 20 minutes in a bowl on the counter, and added a bit of sesame seeds on top when cooking in the oven
