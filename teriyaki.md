# Homemade Teriyaki Sauce
I make a quarter recipe (I just don't need so much), but based on this video:

## Ingredients
* 1/4 Cup Soy Sauce
* 1/4 Cup Mirin
* 1/8 Cup Sugar
* 1/8 Cup Honey
* 1/4 Cup Water
* Small Ginger
* 6 cloves Garlic to taste
* 2 Tbsp Cornstarch

I use pre-minced garlic and ginger, and need to measure

## Directions
Except for cornstarch, mix all the ingredients in a pot on the stove.

Boil and simmer for 15 minutes

Mix cornstarch in small amount of water until it's a slurry (basically just mixed well, and no dry or lumps)

Pour into pot, and simmer a "few" more minutes and you're done.

### Options
I'll add Red Pepper Flakes Sometimes it's great.
