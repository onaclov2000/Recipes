What you need: One cup of milk (both dairy and non-dairy varieties work), half a teaspoon of ground turmeric, half a tablespoon of ground ginger, a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract and maple syrup or honey to taste. 

What you do: Add all the ingredients in a small saucepan and whisk until combined. Turn the heat to medium high and whisk vigorously until it begins to foam--but never allow it to boil. When the thickness is to your liking, remove from the heat and pour into a mug.
