From Nate:
ingriendants: 1 pint heavy whipping cream, 8oz parmesan cheese (older the better), 2tbs butter, salt and peper

over low-mid heat melt the butter, then pur in the heavy whipping cream

then once the cream has heated up enough that you can see steam off the spoon when you after dipping it into the cream then start add the 8oz of cheeze slowly..
