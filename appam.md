# Ingredients
* 2 cups rice flour
* 0.5 cups sugar
* 1.5 cups coconut milk
* .75 cups water
* 1 tablespoon dry active yeast (We used Red Star Quick Rise Yeast For Bread Machines and traditional baking, which we store in the freezer),
* 1.5 tsp water (warm recommended, see note below).
* 1 tsp sugar
* 3/4 cup cooked basmati rice (note below, we used brown didn't turn out bad, maybe experiment with other rices?) 
* 1.5 cups coconut milk
* eggs

# Steps
1. Combine the first four ingredients (flour, sugar, coconut milk and water) in a large mixing bowl and set aside. In a separate container, proof the yeast in the warm-water sugar mixture until it triples in volume, about 10 minutes.

2. Blend the rice and remaining coconut milk in a commercial blender at high speed to form a thick paste. Combine the yeast mixture and contents from the blender with the other ingredients. Using a whisk, stir until no lumps of flour remain. Place in an oven with the pilot light on for about three hours. The mixture should double in size.

3. Heat hopper pan over medium-high heat. Swirl batter in the pan and crack an egg in the middle. Cover and let cook for 2 or 3 minutes. Loosen hopper with a knife and serve.

Notes: 
* We used brown basmati rice, this recipe had a slightly different flavor compared to Geetha's Mom's, it might be that.
    * The rice might have been undercooked, as the texture of the paste after blending was a bit gritty.
* Recipe makes a lot, need to use biggest bowl for proofing.
* Setting heat on big burner to 3.5 approx
    * When cooking with egg or no egg, appam we did about 4 minutes (maybe 4.5 minutes to get the edges a bit more browned)
    * Might be worth experimenting with letting the stuff cook *just a bit* then adding the egg and doing 4 minutes or less
    * Taking the lid off while cooking *might* slow down the cooking
* Toppings can be butter and sugar for the plain appam
* For now consider half recipe
* When we proofed the yeast, I think we used yeast from our freezer so it didnt do anything.
    * I might suggest to just use cold water and sugar, then use the oven method below
    * I added a bit more water and sugar, then heated the oven up to about 110 and left it in, it seemed to activate then
    * Experiment with just using the water and sugar that was specified but using the oven to heat.
