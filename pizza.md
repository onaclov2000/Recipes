Serious Eats

3 3/4 cup bread flour (I use King Arthur Flour, Unbleached Bread Flower)

1/4 tsp active dry yeast

2 tsp sea salt

1.5 cups water (somewhat luke warm)

directions
(2021 update)
I dump everything in our bread machine, set to dough and let it go until it's basically done a good job mixing.
I spray a bowl with olive oil and the plastic wrap and let irmt rise, it rose a lot more this way.

Old directions:

mix dry ingredients well

add Water and Mix thouroughly

Once mixed well, make into ball, spray olive oil (or pour) then put saran wrap on top of the dough and a towel on top of the bowl.


I do this around 6-7am and then make pizzas at 6-7pm.

Preheat oven to max temp (bake, 550 for mine) about an hour ahead of time.

I use a pizza stone you can use the back of a pan (something easy to be able to pull the pizza off from).

I make 4 pizzas per the above batches.

I use parchment paper and roll out on that cutting excess off and put in oven on the parchment.



Freezes well (after cooking, haven't tried "pre-cooking")
