# gut-boosting savory miso oats
Total time: 20 min // Servings: 2-3

## INGREDIENTS
* 1 cup steel cut oats
    * You can use rolled oats, but steel cut provides a nice texture for this dish!
    * This amount will feed 2-3 people, or make great leftovers. Feel free to use less oats for a smaller serving.
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or other type vinegar).
* 1 tablespoon of white miso paste (optional, but recommended!)
    * Can substitute soy sauce
* Optional Toppings:
    * Poached or fried egg
    * Something fermented: like kimchi, sauerkraut, or fermented radishes
    * Saut√©ed greens (spinach, kale, etc) in olive oil and garlic
    * Hemp seeds (extra protein and Omega3s!)
    * Chopped herbs, chives, or furikake (Japanese seaweed & rice mix)
    * A pad of butter!
    * Freshly ground black pepper


## INSTRUCTIONS

* Overnight Soak: In a medium sized bowl, place the oats and cover them with 1 inch of water. Add
a splash (about 1 tbsp) of apple cider vinegar. The soaking and acidity from the vinegar will
make the oats more digestible and cook faster!
You can also let the oats soak for a few hours.
* The next morning, drain the oats. Then place in a small pot and add 1 cup of fresh water or
broth. Cook on low about 10-15 minutes, or until the oats are at the texture you prefer. Steel cut
oats will naturally have more texture and chew to them. If the oats get dry when cooking, add a
splash of water/broth.
* Whisk the 1 tablespoon of miso paste with about 1/4 cup of hot water. Whisk until the miso is
dissolved in the water. Add this to the oatmeal and stir. Taste to see if it need any more miso.
* Serve with the additional toppings and enjoy!

##  TECHNIQUE 
* Oats will double in size when cooked. A 1/2 cup of uncooked oats will usually be about
enough for one serving -- but depending on the person, what else it is being served with,
you may want to eat more or less!
* You can omit the miso and go for more sweet toppings like fruit, nut butter, nuts and
seeds, and a little honey.

## NUTRITION HIGHLIGHTS
* Oats are great source of soluble fiber, which helps to lower excess
cholesterol in the body.
* Miso paste is a fermented food, which means is contains live bacteria.
These bacteria are great for creating a healthy microbiome (also
known as "gut"), which helps to digest food, boost our immune
system, and even regulate our moods!
