# Flatbread

## Recipe by Marilyn Bailey

### Ingredients:
- 2.5 cups flour  
- 1.5 cups graham or wheat flour  
- 3/4 cup shortening (Crisco)  
- 2 cups boiling water  
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Directions:
1. Put dry ingredients in a mixer.  
2. Boil water.  
3. Melt the shortening in the boiling water.  
4. Pour the melted mixture into the dry ingredients.  
5. Mix well.  
6. Roll the dough very thin (similar to lefsa).  
7. Fry on a lefsa grill at around 475°F.  
8. Bake in the oven at 325°F for 12-13 minutes, or until starting to look hard. Flip halfway through.

### Notes from Amanda:
- Bake at 325°F for 12-13 minutes.  
- Roll out with a small amount of flour to prevent sticking.  
- You can use hot water from a water jug instead of boiling water; it works just as well.
