# Flatbread
## Recipe by Marilyn Bailey
## Ingredients
* 2.5 cups flour
* 1.5 cups grahm or wheat flour
* 3/4 cup shortening (crisco)
* 2 cups boiling water
* 1/4 tsp salt

## Directions
1. Put dry ingredients in mixer
2. Boil water
3. Melt the shortening in the boiling water
4. Pour into dry mix.
5. Mix well

Roll very thin (simliar to lefsa)

Fry on lefsa grill at around 475 degrees

bake in oven to brown 325 degrees for 12-13 minutes or until its starting to look hard. I flip them about halfways through.


### Notes from Amanda:
* Bake at 325 for 12-13 minutes
* Roll out with small amount of flour so it doesn't stick to everything
* You can use the hot water from a water jug thing, works as well as boiling
