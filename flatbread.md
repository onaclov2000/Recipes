# Flatbread
## Recipe by Marilyn Bailey
## Ingredients
* 2.5 cups flour
* 1.5 cups grahm or wheat flour
* 3/4 cup shortening (crisco)
* 2 cups boiling water
* 1/4 tsp salt

## Directions
Put dry ingredients in mixer

Boil water.

Melt the shortening in the boiling water

Pour into dry mix.

Mix well

Roll like lefsa

Fry on lefsa grill at around 475 degrees

bake in oven to brown 325 degrees for 12-13 minutes or until its starting to look hard. I flip them about halfways through.


### Notes from Amanda:
* Bake at 325 for 12-13 minutes
* Roll out with small amount of flour so it doesn't stick to everything
* You can use the hot water from a water jug thing, works as well as boiling
